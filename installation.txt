	How to install and use this framework
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Install server system - xampp, wamp, nginx, iis or whatever.
	Add MySQL and PHP binary directory location into your system path.
	You can access system path at:
		> My computer > Right click > properties
		> Advanced system settings
		> Environment Variables
		> New/Edit PATH variable

	For xampp:
		C:\xampp\mysql\bin
		C:\xampp\php

Create a project directory within your htdocs area.
	eg. c:\xampp\htdocs\www.project.com

Edit your hosts file (/etc/hosts or %WINDIR%\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts)
	Add the below lines there
	127.0.0.1	backend
	127.0.0.1	www.example.com

	Notes:
	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	backend Acts as your super admin backend.
	www.example.com can act as your front end and normal backend.
	You will have to create your normal backend yourself using backend

Open MySQL admin tool and create a mysql user for your project.
	CREATE DATABASE my_project CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
	GRANT ALL ON my_project.* TO 'my_project'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
	FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

	Note your parameters:
		Host: localhost
		Database Username: my_project
		Database Password: password
		Database Name: my_project

Open your web browser and browse:
	http://backend/subdomains/www.example.com/

	For the first time, it will try to create self-made database configurations.
	You can follow the instructions there. Later you can change the database with the
	methods discussed just above.

	Your MySQL configuration files in priority are:
		library/classes/common/config.mysql.inc.php
		library/services/backend/config.mysql.inc.php
		library/mysql/<www.project.com>.php
		library/services/<www.example.com>/config.mysql.inc.php
	All these files are your MySQL configuration files for specific purpose.

	Be sure to install the database as well, from the page's instructions.
	Check the files that are NOT in SVN, under: install/sql-scripts directory.
	Normally,
		install-db????????????.bat and,
		pre-install-db????????????.sql
		Run the .bat file

You are almost done!
Follow the instructions on coding patterns and running the framework interface.
