Patterns of controllers are:
	defines-add.php
	defines-delete.php
	defines-details.php
	defines-edit.php
	defines-list.php

Or, with less priorities,
	defines/add.php
	defines/delete.php
	defines/details.php
	defines/edit.php
	defines/list.php

Any other files within this directory will be disregarded.
Rather, use: defines-[action].php file in the parent directory.
