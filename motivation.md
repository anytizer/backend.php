# Motivation

Development of this tool was motivated with some significant requirements.

 * Every developer involved in a project should write similar patterns of code.
 * The website has to be easily theme-able by a designer who does not code.
   - Web designer's work should NOT affect the programmers' work.
 * Easy to adapt the database changes even after the source code is produced.
 * Adding a new CMS page without having to upload a new file.
 * Same website can act as frontend or backend tool based on the user who logged in.
 * Same website can act as Desktop, Mobile or API Version.
   - Small screen
   - Large screen
   - Tables
   - Mobile
   - Wide screens
 * Application should support general programming requirements like:
   - Sending out emails
   - Uploading image files with resize options
   - Uploading other documents
 * Application should support using modern web development practices
   - eg. Use of Angular
   - Should support third party tools.
 
And, there are a lot of requirements, and the application is continuously under development, the core may be unstable forever.
