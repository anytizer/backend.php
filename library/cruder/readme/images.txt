This is a /images directory of this sub-domain (__SUBDOMAIN_NAME__).
Anything here, will appear as if called from the parent.
Write your .images files uniquenly, not matching to the parent's /images/* files.

This uses a special URL rewriring to do so, in the parent framework.

ie.,
<__SUBDOMAIN_NAME__>/images/* <= <subdomain>/library/services/<__SUBDOMAIN_NAME__>/images/*

Notes:
You may copy these files int /images to speed up the operation.
File names here, should NOT match as that in parent's directory.
