We have modified the Smarty's source code in order to use encrypted configurations.
Here are the patches, for new releases:

File: smarty_internal_data.php
:public function getConfigVariable($variable):

#1	$variable = hack_smarty::encrypt_key($variable);
#2	return hack_smarty::decrypt_value($_ptr->config_vars[$variable]);
