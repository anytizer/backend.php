Notes on: Search Engine Authentication Files
============================================

File samples:
Google: googlexxxxxxx.html
Yahoo : y_key_xxxxxxx.html
Bing  : LiveSearchSiteAuth.xml
		MSN
		BING
		MicroSoft
robots.txt

Rather than publishing these directly on the root,
please register them as plain text files within
the corresponding page-names database.

This avoids a confusion when multiple sites share
same name, but different identities, like BING files.

These files should be strictly used for authenticating
known search engines only. Do not put any unauthorized
files directly on the server's root.
